This project determines how different wines in the region of France are grouped into three different cultivars based on 13 different chemical composition of the wine. Included in this project is the "wine.csv" data, the python/Jupiter notebook file used in data analysis, and a skew_transform file (https://datamadness.github.io/Skewness_Auto_Transform). This project was done as a part of a Data Analysis class at Mission College.
