# DataAnalysisProjects

This repository contains data analysis projects that I've completed. Descriptions are as follows:
* WineCultivar - initial Data analysis project done for my Intro to Data Analysis class
* SJCPolice_Part1_DataCleaning (pdf and ipynb versions) - contain the methodology and steps taken
  for cleaning the San Jose Police Call log data from years 2018-2022. This project was done with 
  partnership with Tiffany Overbo for an Intro to Data Science class
* SJCPolice_Part2_DataAnalysis (pdf and ipynb versions) - contain the data analysis portion. 
* SJCPolice_Part3_ML_PriorityCode.ipynb - contains a preliminary machine learning classification model 
  in predicting the priority code assignments for call incidents. Further development of this model is needed
  and will be posted in the MLProjects repository
